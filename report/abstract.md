The standby safety components in nuclear facilities are crucial for ensuring safe and reliable energy production. The stochastic nature of failure times of said components poses a challenge to the prompt detection and correction of failure. In this paper, we use an alternating renewal process to model the downtime of a system subject to interruptions by failure, inspection, and maintenance. We derive a general expression for expected unavailability using the renewal theory and obtain an equation whose roots provide an optimal inspection frequency that minimises unavailability under varying conditions. Additionally, we develop algorithms and implement code to simulate the renewal process, obtaining numerical results using the Monte Carlo method. By computing expectation and simulations, we find that for a system with a mean time between failures of $17.72$ months, an inspection rate of $3.33$ per day, and a maintenance rate of $0.14$ per day, the optimal inspection frequency is approximately $0.05$ per day. Under the same conditions, we find that the difference between the average unavailability evaluated at inspection frequencies of $0.05$ per day and $0.03$ per day is not statistically significant, suggesting a more cost-efficient inspection and maintenance policy than the analytical optimal solution.
