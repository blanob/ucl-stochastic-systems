    "A manual shutdown was initiated during a start-up operation on February 25, 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At 4:03 AM, an alarm was triggered due to a pressure increase to 7.1 MPa, exceeding the regulatory limit of 6.91 MPa.\n",
    "- It was confirmed that the alarm was caused by the shutting of a **turbine bypass valve**.\n",
    "- At 8:49 AM, all control rods were inserted, and the reactor was manually shut down.\n",
